Thank you for your purchase of this texture set from MVG86's online shop. You must have purchased it from turbosquid.com as a zip file, extracted the zip file, 
opened the folder where it is extracted, and then opened this file ("instructions.txt"). 

If you have followed the steps above, read on. If not, then please check the source of your purchase.

It has to be www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/MVG86 or a link after you are redirected from that page or maybe you searched in google, which is fine too.

This is a collection of 10 good quality textures, with many cool features. All textures are at least 99 percent seamless, and contain all the different maps like ao,
displacement etc. Each image is of the size 1024 x 1024 pixels


########### IMPORTANT INFO #############

1. After you extract the file, you will be presented with one or more folders and this file. The folders are named file1, file2, file3 etc.

2. Each folder contains different exported forms of a single image having many layers. That single image is available in the folder itself. It is of the extension ".xcf"
	which is made and editable using gimp. You can use it to do whatever you want, eg to add more effects, combine one or more layers etc.

3. The folder named extracted contains all the extracted images. It has 2 subfolders, "1basic" & "2complete". The folder named "1basic" contains just the basic images,
	which are larger versions (1024 x 1024 px) of the previews shown at turbosquid. The folder named "2complete" contains the larger versions, plus occlusion maps,
	normal maps, diffuse maps, height maps, specular maps, etc. All the maps are created using insane bump.
	
	the _n is the normal map,
	the _s is the specular map,
	the _d is the diffusion map (just the color),
	the _a is the ambient occlusion (ao),
	the _h is the displacement (or height map)
	
	and a few extras...
	
4. You can use these textures and maps in any way that you want, the best uses I find are video games, animated movies, 3d objects or just base textures for multitextured
	images or fusion textures.
